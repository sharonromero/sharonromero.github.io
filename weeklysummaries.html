<h2>Weekly Summaries</h2>

<p><strong>Weekly Summary October 8-12</strong></p>
<p>This week I learned that learning full stack web development has its ups and downs. At one moment I may feel great because I was able to figure something out or I was able to grasp something quickly
  but the next moment I might feel down because something went way over my head or I just couldn't figure something out. I also learned that other people are feeling this way too, that these feelings
  are normal, and that even people who have been developing for years can still have these feelings. I have grown by coming to understand that I am not alone in this journey and that although I am a
  complete beginner, there are some things that I am actually able to accomplish.</p>

<p>I'm not a fan of social media so I'm not on many social media sites, hence the reason I didn't come up when I Googled myself. I try to stay off of social media sites as much as possible. Social media is good for some things but overall I don't like it. I am finding more and more that there are many more people than I thought who also try to stay away from social media sites.</p>

<p><strong>Weekly Summary October 29-November 2</strong></p>

<p>Collaborative Game</p>
<p>My team started with Forbidden Island by reading the directions and discussing what we thought certain parts meant. As we went along, we kept communicating about what we
  thought was supposed to be done as each person took a turn. We had good communication throughout the game. We all played cooperatively and helped each other as we played.
  We didn't finish the game but I think we would've won if we had been able to continue until the end. </p>

  <p><strong>Weekly Summary November 5-9</strong></p>

  <p>Visiting Fuse Makerspace was interesting. It was interesting to hear what goes on there and what people are working on there. I had heard about it before I started the coding bootcamp but to actually see it was cool.</p>
  <p>The trip to 1 Million Cups was also interesting. I didn't know a place like that existed and it is nice to know that a place like that is there to assist entrepreneurs. I always like finding out about new places that exist and
    potential resources that I may need in the future or that someone I know might need. I wasn't excited about having to talk to people I didn't know and have never met. I know expecting that of me and many of the other people in the
    class was a little bit annoying. If anyone knows anything about introverts it is that we hate small talk. Small talk is actually a huge pet peeve for introverts. Plus, asking an introvert to go out and make small talk to strangers
    is quite annoying. I wish extroverts would take some time to understand introverts instead of just focuing on themselves. Extroverts seem to think that by forcing introverts to have small talk with a complete stranger will change turn
    use into extroverts if we do it enough. That is totally untrue, though. Keeping to ourselves is a part of our personality and hard-wired into our DNA. It is something that can't be changed. Asking introverts to go out and have small
    talk with a stranger is like asking an extrovert not to talk for an entire day or to lock themselves in a room for an entire day with no human interaction. I didn't talk to anyone attending 1 Million cups but I did talk to some
    Deep Dive coding bootcamp students. I had the chance to talk with one of my own classmates, which was nice since I didn't know much about him. I also had the chance to meet and talk with one of the Java students. I also heard that there
    were too many Deep Dive coding bootcamp students visiting 1 Million Cups. It turned out that there were too many Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp students attending the meeting because they had already talked to bootcamp student and didn't want
    to talk to another one.</p>
    <p>I didn't interview a Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp alumni because I don't even know where to find one. </p>
