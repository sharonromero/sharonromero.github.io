<h2>Weekly Summaries</h2>

<p><strong>Weekly Summary October 8-12</strong></p>
<p>This week I learned that learning full stack web development has its ups and downs. At one moment I may feel great because I was able to figure something out or I was able to grasp something quickly
  but the next moment I might feel down because something went way over my head or I just couldn't figure something out. I also learned that other people are feeling this way too, that these feelings
  are normal, and that even people who have been developing for years can still have these feelings. I have grown by coming to understand that I am not alone in this journey and that although I am a
  complete beginner, there are some things that I am actually able to accomplish.</p>

<p>I'm not a fan of social media so I'm not on many social media sites, hence the reason I didn't come up when I Googled myself. I try to stay off of social media sites as much as possible. Social media is good for some things but overall I don't like it. I am finding more and more that there are many more people than I thought who also try to stay away from social media sites.</p>

<p><strong>Weekly Summary October 29-November 2</strong></p>

<p>Collaborative Game</p>
<p>My team started with Forbidden Island by reading the directions and discussing what we thought certain parts meant. As we went along, we kept communicating about what we
  thought was supposed to be done as each person took a turn. We had good communication throughout the game. We all played cooperatively and helped each other as we played.
  We didn't finish the game but I think we would've won if we had been able to continue until the end. </p>

  <p><strong>Weekly Summary November 5-9</strong></p>

  <p>I was excited to visit Fuse Makerspace because I had read about it prior to joining the bootcamp and wanted to see what it was like. It was interesting to hear about all that goes on there and the projects that people are working on. It is a great public resource.</p>

  <p>1 Million Cups was interesting. I didn't know a place like that existed and it is nice to know that entrepreneurs can go there for help. I always like finding out about various resources that are available to the public. I will definitely keep it in mind should
    I ever become an entrepreneur or if I ever come across an entrepreneur who would benefit from the resources at 1 Million Cups.</p>

  <p>Although I was interested in finding out what 1 Million Cups was about, I wasn't excited about having to talk to people I don't know. I'm usually okay with people talking to me first but I'm not the kind of person who would go up to someone and just start talking to them.
    I know some of the other bootcamp students had a really hard time with this. There is nothing wrong with that, it's just something that's hard wired in our DNA. Plus, I don't feel I am ready to tell complete strangers my elevator pitch since we're only halfway through the
    bootcamp and I don't feel that I know enough of anything at this point to get any type of work in web development. So, not surprisingly, I didn't talk to anyone attending the 1 Million cups meeting but I did talk to a Java bootcamp student that I had never talked to before and I had the
    chance to talk with one of my own Full Stack Web bootcamp classmates, which was nice since I didn't know much about him.</p>

  <p>I also didn't interview a Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp alum because if there were any at 1 Million Cups, I was not aware of which people were Deep Dive alumni. I suppose if I absolutely need to interview a recent alum I could interview Jude since he is the only one I know
    other than George, Brent, and Erik. </p>

  <p><strong>Weekly Summary November 12-16</strong></p>
  <p>This week I worked on unit testing. It was complicated and hard and not something I enjoyed. The only somewhat interesting part was running the test and seeing what passed and what didn't. I may be the only one in class who likes entering commands into the command line so that
  may be another reason why I found running the test interesting. Creating the statements for the test and having to find the errors was difficult and tedious. Once that was done, though, I was able to get back to work on my pwp, which was good since I hadn't had time to work on
  it all week because of unit testing.</p>

  <p>I also attended the meeting for the app contest on Saturday. Although, I'm not a social butterfly, it was nice meeting the people who also attended. I met a couple of new people and enjoyed hearing what brought them to the app contest, what their app ideas were, and learning
    about their backgrounds. It was also interesting to actually see what FreeRange was like.</p>

  <p><strong>Weekly Summary November 19-23</strong></p>
  <p>This week was a short week, which was nice. We started the week off with some more ridiculous snap challenges. Since we had used Insomnia previously, some of us thought we were supposed to use Insomnia for the snap challenge. I started doing it in Insomnia but although I had no idea what
    I was doing, it didn't look like it was correct so I switched to PHP Storm and it seemed to work better there. Like the majority of the snap challenges we do, I just took a guess since we are "challenged" on things we don't know how to do. Anyway, beginning the challenge in Insomnia then going to
    PHP Storm wasted time, which was annoying. After the challenge some people said they had completed it in Insomnia since it was never clear what program we were supposed to be working in. The wasted time and some of the frustration could've been alleviated if we had just been told in the beginning which
    program we were supposed to be using.</p>
  <p>This week we also had an assessment. As George said in standup earlier in the week, we're basically just being assessed on how well we can copy and paste. That is the truth since all we pretty much do is copy the Twitter code examples. It's very sad that we're finishing up week seven and we only know how to copy
      the Twitter code. You'd think by now we'd know how to write our own methods, statements, etc. but unfortunately that is not the case. I took my time doing the assessment since George said we had all day to complete it. I was one of the last ones to finish but I didn't really care because I wanted to take my time
      and copy the code correctly.</p>

  <p><strong>Weekly Summary November 26-30</strong></p>
  <p>There was a lot going on this week. We went through Angular, which was quite a bit of information. George walked us through setting up the Angular files, which was nice and much appreciated.</p>

  <p>We also had HR interviews and tech interviews. The HR interview was a bit strange because it was weird trying to pretend that I was in an actual interview while also knowing that it wasn't going to lead to anything. Plus, my mind that day was mostly on my PWP, which was due the next day, and also on the tech interview
    because I didn't know what to expect for that interview. So, needless to say, the HR interview was the least of my concerns that day.</p>

  <p>The HR interviewer did give me a good piece of advice about providing more information about myself during the interview but not looking at it as trying to sell myself; just providing more information so the interviewer can get to know me better. He marked me low because I didn't ask any questions about his company.
    When I'm in an actual interview, I normally ask questions about the company I am interviewing with and it had crossed my mind to ask him questions about his company but I had researched his company's website the day before and since it wasn't of much interest to me and because this was a mock interview, I decided not to ask any
    questions. I did ask him about his experience in web design, though, and what technologies he used. He asked me where I saw myself in five years and I told him I was interested in both front-end web development and in MySQL and other database programs and that I found the command line interesting. I told him that when the
    bootcamp was over that I would have to look into which direction I really wanted to go in. He told me that although I don't know which direction I want to go in that I should act as though I do know and pick one and talk about it. I thought that was strange advice because I can't say at this point what direction I want to go in and
    I didn't want to just pick one for the sake of the interview. If this had been an actual interview for an actual job that I had applied for then obviously I would have talked about one or the other depending on what type of job I had applied for.</p>

  <p>The tech interview was quite a differenct experience. George had told us during standup awhile back that we weren't ready for the tech interview so we weren't going to be interviewed by a tech company. That was a small relief but it was still a nerve-wracking experience since we knew we weren't ready for it. George ended up doing my
     tech interview, which was fine with me, since I knew that he knew that I wasn't ready for it. I was able to fumble my way through some of the questions but it was no surprise to me, and I'm sure to George, that my answers were mostly incorrect. It was weird, though, having to pretend that George wasn't George.</p>

  <p>After the interviews, we were given time to work on our PWPs. Most of the class was going through the same problems with the form that was required on our PWP. Some of us worked together to figure out our problem and then we helped others with the problems they were having that we had already faced. For the problems that we just couldn't
     figure out, George and Brent did a really nice job of helping us all figure out our issues. George helped a group of us in the classroom while Brent helped another group in the kitchen. It was nice as we all worked together to figure out how to get the form to work properly. George also extended the deadline for the PWP by one day,
     which was great, and thanks to George and Brent's help, I was ready to submit my project with a fully-functioning form by the new deadline.</p>

  <p>The next day, we covered security, which was an interesting topic, and provided a lot of insight into why so many companies have a problem with information being compromised on their websites. It just makes more sense to put more time and money into the security of a website that way you don't become the next news story on
    how you should've done a better job of keeping people's information safe.</p>

  <p>Friday, George postponed the war games that he had planned and met with our groups regarding our API testing, instead. I was glad he had made that decision because I really needed to get back to API testing. It also allowed my group to have a much-needed discussion on how our website should look.</P>

  <p>Friday ended with a discussion from Karen about working from home and a discussion from Nick about algorithms. Pretty much everything Karen mentioned about working from home I had experienced when I worked from home. Working from home is great in the beginning but as most of my former coworkers and I quickly found out,
    it is highly overrated.</p>

  <p>Nick always seems to provide a great presentation. I had checked out a book from the library on algorithms a couple of weeks ago so Friday night I looked up the algorithms Nick had discussed. I was happy to find that the book did include Dynamic Programming, The Bellman-Ford algorithm, A*, and Dijkstra's Algorithm. I definitely
     want to read more about them once the bootcamp is over.</p>

  <p>Finally, the week ended with George opening up the building during the weekend since we lost those two days due to Thanksgiving. The extra time in the buidling over the weekend was super helpful as it allowed my group to make some progress on our API testing.</p>

  <p><strong>Weekly Summary December 3-7</strong></p>
  <p>This week we worked on our capstone project. I'll be so glad when this week is over.</p>
