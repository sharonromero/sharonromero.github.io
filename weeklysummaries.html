<h2>Weekly Summaries</h2>

<p><strong>Weekly Summary October 8-12</strong></p>
<p>This week I learned that learning full stack web development has its ups and downs. At one moment I may feel great because I was able to figure something out or I was able to grasp something quickly
  but the next moment I might feel down because something went way over my head or I just couldn't figure something out. I also learned that other people are feeling this way too, that these feelings
  are normal, and that even people who have been developing for years can still have these feelings. I have grown by coming to understand that I am not alone in this journey and that although I am a
  complete beginner, there are some things that I am actually able to accomplish.</p>

<p>I'm not a fan of social media so I'm not on many social media sites, hence the reason I didn't come up when I Googled myself. I try to stay off of social media sites as much as possible. Social media is good for some things but overall I don't like it. I am finding more and more that there are many more people than I thought who also try to stay away from social media sites.</p>

<p><strong>Weekly Summary October 29-November 2</strong></p>

<p>Collaborative Game</p>
<p>My team started with Forbidden Island by reading the directions and discussing what we thought certain parts meant. As we went along, we kept communicating about what we
  thought was supposed to be done as each person took a turn. We had good communication throughout the game. We all played cooperatively and helped each other as we played.
  We didn't finish the game but I think we would've won if we had been able to continue until the end. </p>

  <p><strong>Weekly Summary November 5-9</strong></p>

  <p>I was excited to visit Fuse Makerspace because I had read about it prior to joining the bootcamp and wanted to see what it was like. It was interesting to hear about all that goes on there and the projects that people are working on. It is a great public resource.</p>

  <p>1 Million Cups was interesting. I didn't know a place like that existed and it is nice to know that entrepreneurs can go there for help. I always like finding out about various resources that are available to the public. I will definitely keep it in mind should
    I ever become an entrepreneur or if I ever come across an entrepreneur who would benefit from the resources at 1 Million Cups.</p>

  <p>Although I was interested in finding out what 1 Million Cups was about, I wasn't excited about having to talk to people I don't know. I'm usually okay with people talking to me first but I'm not the kind of person who would go up to someone and just start talking to them.
    I know some of the other bootcamp students had a really hard time with this. There is nothing wrong with that, it's just something that's hard wired in our DNA. Plus, I don't feel I am ready to tell complete strangers my elevator pitch since we're only halfway through the
    bootcamp and I don't feel that I know enough of anything at this point to get any type of work in web development. So, not surprisingly, I didn't talk to anyone attending the 1 Million cups meeting but I did talk to a Java bootcamp student that I had never talked to before and I had the
    chance to talk with one of my own Full Stack Web bootcamp classmates, which was nice since I didn't know much about him.</p>

  <p>I also didn't interview a Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp alum because if there were any at 1 Million Cups, I was not aware of which people were Deep Dive alumni. I suppose if I absolutely need to interview a recent alum I could interview Jude since he is the only one I know
    other than George, Brent, and Erik. </p>

  <p><strong>Weekly Summary November 12-16</strong></p>
  <p>This week I worked on unit testing. It was complicated and hard and not something I enjoyed. The only somewhat interesting part was running the test and seeing what passed and what didn't. I may be the only one in class who likes entering commands into the command line so that
  may be another reason why I found running the test interesting. Creating the statements for the test and having to find the errors was difficult and tedious. Once that was done, though, I was able to get back to work on my pwp, which was good since I hadn't had time to work on
  it all week because of unit testing.</p>

  <p>I also attended the meeting for the app contest on Saturday. Although, I'm not a social butterfly, it was nice meeting the people who also attended. I met a couple of new people and enjoyed hearing what brought them to the app contest, what their app ideas were, and learning
    about their backgrounds. It was also interesting to actually see what FreeRange was like.</p>

  <p><strong>Weekly Summary November 19-23</strong></p>
  <p>This week was a short week, which was nice. We started the week off with those ridiculous snap challenges. Since we had used Insomnia previously, some of us thought we were supposed to use Insomnia for the snap challenge. I tried doing it in Insomnia but although I had no idea what
    I was doing, it didn't look like it was correct so I switched to PHP Storm and it seemed to work better there. Like the majority of the snap challenges we do, I just took a guess since we are "challenged" on things we don't know how to do. Anyway, beginning in Insomnia then going to
    PHP Storm wasted time, which was annoying. After the challenge some others said they had completed it in Insomnia since it was never clear what we were supposed to be working in. The wasted time and frustration could've been alleviated if we had just been told in the beginning which
    program we were supposed to be using.</p>
  <p>This week we also had an assessment. As George said in standup earlier in the week, we're basically just being assessed on how well we can copy and paste since all we pretty much do is copy the Twitter code examples. It's very sad that we're finishing up week seven and we only know how to copy
      the Twitter code. You'd think by now we'd know how to write our own methods, statements, etc. but unfortunately that is not the case.</p>
