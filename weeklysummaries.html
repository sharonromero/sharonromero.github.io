<h2>Weekly Summaries</h2>

<p><strong>Weekly Summary October 8-12</strong></p>
<p>This week I learned that learning full stack web development has its ups and downs. At one moment I may feel great because I was able to figure something out or I was able to grasp something quickly
  but the next moment I might feel down because something went way over my head or I just couldn't figure something out. I also learned that other people are feeling this way too, that these feelings
  are normal, and that even people who have been developing for years can still have these feelings. I have grown by coming to understand that I am not alone in this journey and that although I am a
  complete beginner, there are some things that I am actually able to accomplish.</p>

<p>I'm not a fan of social media so I'm not on many social media sites, hence the reason I didn't come up when I Googled myself. I try to stay off of social media sites as much as possible. Social media is good for some things but overall I don't like it. I am finding more and more that there are many more people than I thought who also try to stay away from social media sites.</p>

<p><strong>Weekly Summary October 29-November 2</strong></p>

<p>Collaborative Game</p>
<p>My team started with Forbidden Island by reading the directions and discussing what we thought certain parts meant. As we went along, we kept communicating about what we
  thought was supposed to be done as each person took a turn. We had good communication throughout the game. We all played cooperatively and helped each other as we played.
  We didn't finish the game but I think we would've won if we had been able to continue until the end. </p>

  <p><strong>Weekly Summary November 5-9</strong></p>

  <p>I was excited to visit Fuse Makerspace because I had read about it prior to joining the bootcamp and wanted to see what it was like. It was interesting to hear about all that goes on there and the projects that people are working on. It is a great public resource.</p>

  <p>1 Million Cups was interesting. I didn't know a place like that existed and it is nice to know that entrepreneurs can go there for help. I always like finding out about various resources that are available to the public. I will definitely keep it in mind should
    I ever become an entrepreneur or if I ever come across an entrepreneur who would benefit from the resources at 1 Million Cups.</p>

  <p>Although I was interested in finding out what 1 Million Cups was about, I wasn't excited about having to talk to people I don't know. I'm usually okay with people talking to me first but I'm not the kind of person who would go up to someone and just start talking to them.
    I know some of the other bootcamp students had a really hard time with this. There is nothing wrong with that, it's just something that's hard wired in our DNA. Plus, I don't feel I am ready to tell complete strangers my elevator pitch since we're only halfway through the bootcamp and
    I don't feel that I know enough of anything at this point to get any type of work in web development. So, not surprisingly, I didn't talk to anyone attending the 1 Million cups meeting but I did talk to a Java bootcamp student that I had never talked to before and I had the
    chance to talk with one of my own Full Stack Web bootcamp classmates, which was nice since I didn't know much about him.</p>

    <p>I also didn't interview a Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp alum because if there were any at 1 Million Cups, I was not aware of which people were Deep Dive alumni. I suppose if I absolutely need to interview a recent alum I could interview Jude since he is the only one I know
      other than George, Brent, and Erik. </p>
