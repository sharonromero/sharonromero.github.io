<p><strong>Weekly Summary October 8-12</strong></p>
<p>This week I learned that learning full stack web development has its ups and downs. At one moment I may feel great because I was able to figure something out or I was able to grasp something quickly
  but the next moment I might feel down because something went way over my head or I just couldn't figure something out. I also learned that other people are feeling this way too, that these feelings
  are normal, and that even people who have been developing for years can still have these feelings. I have grown by coming to understand that I am not alone in this journey and that although I am a
  complete beginner, there are some things that I am actually able to accomplish.</p>

<p>I'm not a fan of social media so I'm not on many social media sites. I try to stay off of them as much as possible. Social media is good for some things but overall I don't like it. I am finding more and more that there are many more people than I thought who also try to stay away from social media sites.</p>
