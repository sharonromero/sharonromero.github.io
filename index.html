<h2>Passion Project</h2>
  <p>A caterer I once knew had a lemon chicken salad that she would serve at our meetings. I loved it so much that I wanted to make it myself. I couldn't ask her for the recipe because
    I knew she wouldn't give it to me so I searched for recipes online until I found something similar to it. I then tweaked it until I was able to get it
    just right and it was exactly like the one the caterer made. I used the creative side of my brain to find the right ingredients and play with them to make sure they would blend together perfectly
    to match the caterer's recipe and I used the logical side of my brain to measure out the correct amounts of the ingredients for the recipe.</p>

<h2>Why, How, What</h2>

  <p>Hi, my name is Sharon. I create websites to get people outdoors and get moving. I like to hear people's feedback on where they like to go to when they spend time outdoors. Would you like to share
    your favorite outdoor places that you would recommend to others?</p>

<h2>Weekly Summary October 8-12</h2>
<p>This week I learned that learning full stack web development has its ups and downs. At one moment I may feel great because I was able to figure something out or I was able to grasp something quickly
  but the next moment I might feel down because something went way over my head or I just couldn't figure something out. I also learned that other people are feeling this way too, that these feelings
  are normal, and that even people who have been developing for years can still have these feelings. I have grown by coming to understand that I am not alone in this journey and that although I am a
  complete beginner, there are some things that I am actually able to accomplish.</p>

<p>This picture represents how I felt at my last job. I had been doing the same thing for eleven and a half years with no room for advancement or growth.
  I was bored out of my mind and felt stuck.</p>

  <p>This picture represents where I'd like to be in three years. Right now, going through the bootcamp, I have very little time for anything else, including my dog, who got used to <menu>
    working at home for the past year. Now I don't have much time for her or for anything else so in three years I'd like to have a nice, stable job that allows me to have time to spend time with
    my dog and do other stuff in my free time.</p>
